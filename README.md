# What is Oblong?

Oblong is a Typescript UI framework for helping you develop client applications efficiently with just the right amount of boilerplate.

It intends to be a meta framework: as long as the user experience is uniform and complete, existing popular libraries are used instead of reinventing the wheel. The benefit of this approach is that you get a clean and cohesive development experience while having the stability, performance, and feature-set (through escape hatches) of the underlying battle-tested libraries.

# Architecture

Oblong embraces one way data flow using the core four pieces:

1. **State** is for any value you want to store and change
2. **Views** are how you render your app and handle user inputs
3. **Commands** perform any work such as making API calls
4. **Queries** keep state clean by computing derived state efficiently

# Installation

Available through npm: `npm i oblong`

`createApp` is where you configure Oblong. All configuration is optional except at least one route:

```tsx
import { createApp } from 'oblong'
import { Home } from './home'

export const App = createApp({
  routes: {
    '/': Home,
  },
})
```

You can use Oblong anywhere you can use React. Use the generated App component as you normally would. Here's a web example:

```tsx
import { render } from 'react-dom'
import { App } from './app'

render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'))
```

# Quick Start

Let's build a counter game where we have to click the counter up fast enough to hit the max. You can see a complete and interactive version [on StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/edit/oblong-counter-game?file=index.tsx). First we need some **state** to store the click count:

```tsx
import { state } from 'oblong'

const clickCount = state('myGame.clickCount').as(0)
```

For simplicity, we'll stop at a hard coded 10 clicks. Keen eyes notice this is derived state, which is exactly what **query** is for:

```tsx
import { query } from 'oblong'

const isPlaying = query()
  .with({ clickCount }) // ‚¨Ö Dependency Injection! üéâ
  .as((o) => o.clickCount < 10)
```

Each click will bump the count up, but be quick, because it will come back down in 2 seconds!

```tsx
import { command } from 'oblong'

const fallDown = command()
  .with({ clickCount, isPlaying })
  .as((o) => {
    if (o.isPlaying) {
      o.clickCount = o.clickCount - 1 // ‚¨Ö That's actually immutable Redux! üí™
    }
  })

const hitUp = command()
  .with({ clickCount, isPlaying, fallDown }) // ‚¨Ö State, Queries, & Commands! ü§≠
  .as((o) => {
    if (o.isPlaying) {
      o.clickCount = o.clickCount + 1

      setTimeout(o.fallDown, 2000)
    }
  })
```

Now that your state, calculations, and interactivity are broken out (as they should be üòâ), views can focus on what they do best:

```tsx
import { view } from 'oblong'

const Game = view()
  .with({ clickCount, hitUp, isPlaying })
  .as((o) => (
    <>
      <button onClick={o.hitUp} disabled={!o.isPlaying}>
        ‚òùÔ∏è
      </button>
      <label>{o.isPlaying ? `${o.clickCount} clicks` : `You won!`}</label>
      <progress max="10" value={o.clickCount} />
    </>
  ))
```

And that's it, your first Oblong application! ü•≥ If low boilerplate Redux, natural language fluent api, full React hook compatibility, built-in routing, and dependency injection weren't enough, this is your friendly reminder that Oblong is a Typescript framework. The application we just built in this quick start is 100% fully typed through inference, without a single type definition!
